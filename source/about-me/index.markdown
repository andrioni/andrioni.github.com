I'm currently a grad student in Applied Mathematics in 
[Unicamp](http://www.unicamp.br/unicamp/?language=en), Brazil and 
a Business Inteligence Analyst at [Dafiti](http://www.dafiti.com.br/).

I'll probably write more about myself later, until then you can find 
more about what I code in my [Github page](https://github.com/andrioni/) 
and about my research on [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Andrioni_A/0/1/0/all/0/1) (not much yet on that front, unfortunately!)
