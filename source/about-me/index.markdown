I'm currently a grad student in Applied Mathematics in [Unicamp](http://www.unicamp.br/unicamp/?language=en), Brazil.

I'll probably write more about myself later, until then you can find more about what I code in my [Github page](https://github.com/andrioni/) and about my research on [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Andrioni_A/0/1/0/all/0/1) (not much yet on that front, unfortunately!)
