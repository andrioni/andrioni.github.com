	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name">GSoC FLINT Project Accepted and the Start of (Heavily Delayed, Sorry!) Blog Posts</h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello! As the end of semester took much more time than I imagined, I ended up delaying writing posts about my progress on GSoC, though this will be hopefully corrected by a lot of updates in the following days discussing both the state of the work and the design decisions I took/shall have to take during the development of the library during this summer/winter.</p>

<p>All forms of feedback and comments are both welcomed and encouraged!</p>

<h2>Status</h2>

<p>The code is currently available on <a href="https://github.com/andrioni/flint2/tree/d_mat">the <code>d_mat</code> branch of my flint2 fork on Github</a>. Most of the basic features for double-precision vectors and matrices is implemented already, though not yet optimized. There are also some tests written, but I&#8217;m not yet satisfied with their broadness, and this will probably lead to the implementation of more functions to generate random doubles. The existing code for MPFR-backed vectors was also extended, but most tests for it aren&#8217;t written yet.</p>

<p>Documentation is currently mostly sketched and uncommitted, as I&#8217;m awaiting to stabilize a bit the planned API before finishing it.</p>

<h2>List of issues faced so far</h2>

<ul>
<li>The function currently being used to generate doubles, <code>d_randtest</code>, generates numbers only between [0.5, 1), though Fredrik has already given orientation on how to generate other random doubles from that;</li>
<li>No special care has been taken to deal with NaNs and infinities, though according to Bill this isn&#8217;t really important to most applications in number theory;</li>
<li>The old <code>mpfr_vec</code> header was a bit confusing, as some functions were using <code>__mpfr_struct</code> instead of <code>mpfr</code> (which is just typedef&#8217;d to <code>__mpfr_struct</code> on <code>flint.h</code>, and is much more readable). I decided to standardize them on <code>mpfr</code> for clarity, and added the <code>const</code> keyword where it was possible;</li>
<li>There is already <code>_mpfr_vec_scalar_product</code> function written, while I decided to name the double precision version <code>_d_vec_innerprod</code>, and it would be better to have one standard name. Both of them seem reasonable to me, and I strongly welcome any input on which one is better!</li>
<li>It seems that the old code was written based on MPFR 2.4 (or older versions), and it seems to be the last version supported by MinGW (though MinGW-w64 supports 3.1). I&#8217;m currently trying to keep compatibility as much as I can, but it could be good to formally define which MPFR version flint requires;</li>
<li>A related issue is the use of <code>GMP_RNDN</code> as the rounding mode constant used instead of <code>MPFR_RNDN</code> (available on 3.0 and above).</li>
</ul>


<h2>List of possible extra ideas for the following weeks</h2>

<ul>
<li>Using either/both the <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/CompileFarm">GCC Compile Farm</a> or <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis CI</a> to automatically run tests on different platforms and compilers;</li>
<li>Writing something to track performance of the linear algebra functions to help benchmarking and to find more easily performance regressions.</li>
</ul>


<p>To work!</p>
